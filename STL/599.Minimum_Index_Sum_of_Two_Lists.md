## 问题描述
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

Note:
- The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
- The length of strings in both lists will be in - the range of [1, 30].
- The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
- No duplicates in both lists.

```cpp
vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {
    unordered_map<string, int> hash;
    for(vector<string>::size_type i=0; i< list1.size(); ++i)
        hash[list1[i]] = i;
    unsigned minIndexSum = list1.size() + list2.size();
    vector<string> res;
    for(vector<string>::size_type i=0; i< list2.size(); ++i){
        if(hash.find(list2[i]) != hash.end()){
            if(minIndexSum >= hash[list2[i]] + i){
                if(minIndexSum > hash[list2[i]] + i)
                    res.clear();
                res.push_back(list2[i]);
                minIndexSum = hash[list2[i]] + i;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
