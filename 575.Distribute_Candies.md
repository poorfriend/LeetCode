## 问题描述

Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain.

Example 1:
```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 
```

Example 2:
```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 
```

## 解法

#### 我的解法
```cpp
int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candies) {
    unordered_map<int, int> hash;
    for(auto e: candies)
        ++hash[e];
    int style = hash.size();
    if(style <= candies.size() / 2)
        return style;
    else
        return candies.size() / 2;
}
```
#### 优秀解法1
```cpp
int longestPalindrome(string s) {
    vector<int> count(256); //大小固定， 可以不用字典
    for (char c : s)
        ++count[c];
    int odds = 0;
    for (int c : count)
        odds += c & 1; //计算奇数的个数， c & 1判断是否是奇数
    return s.size() - odds + (odds > 0);
}
```

#### 优秀解法1
```cpp
int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candies) {
    unordered_set<int> kinds;
    for (int kind : candies) {
        kinds.insert(kind);
    }
    return min(kinds.size(), candies.size() / 2);
}
```

#### 优秀解法2
```cpp
int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candies) { 
    //unordered_set, inset, min的用法
    return min(unordered_set<int>(candies.begin(), candies.end()).size(), candies.size() / 2);
}
